                    <p>At Collins Chiropractic we understand how pain, whether it&#39;s in your neck, back or other
                        joints, can disrupt your life, limiting your mobility and affecting your overall well-being. Our
                        aim is to work closely with you to achieve your goals.
                        </p><br>
                    <p>The state of our health can significantly influence our perspective on life. Having optimally
                        functioning joints and muscles brings numerous benefits, such as improved mobility,
                        reduced pain, and greater freedom to engage in the activities you enjoy.</p>

                    <p>Our health is shaped by various factors, including habits, postures, experiences with trauma
                        and stress, and dietary choices. Lifestyle contributors to health and wellbeing include
                        looking after our physical health, mental health, sleep habits as well as having healthy
                        relationships, minimising harmful substances and healthy eating habits. The good news is
                        that these factors are not fixed and can be positively influenced with appropriate support
                        and encouragement.</p>

            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>The spine is a remarkable structure with diverse and sometimes conflicting responsibilities.
                    It must be both strong enough to protect the spinal cord, which connects the brain to the
                    body, and flexible enough to accommodate a wide range of human movements.
                    Maintaining this delicate balance is where chiropractic care plays a vital role.</p>

            <img src="column.gif" alt="Image 5">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Nearly 2500 years ago, Hippocrates (who is sometimes called the father of western
                    medicine) said &quot;look to the spine for the cause of disease&quot;, and even today, although we
                    realise that there are many other factors involved, a properly functioning musculoskeletal
                    and nervous system is one of the foundations upon which optimal human movement
                    depend. Today chiropractors, like osteopaths, physiotherapists and other musculoskeletal
                    therapists recognise the importance of maintaining movement for easing discomfort and
                    allowing for involvement in daily activities.</p>

            <h2>Chiropractic Focus</h2>
            <img src="chiropractic.gif" alt="Image 6">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Chiropractors focus on the whole musculoskeletal system, particularly the spine and pelvis,
                    using specific spinal manipulations, also known as &#39;adjustments,&#39; to correct dysfunctions.
                    These adjustments have two primary effects: mechanical, enhancing joint mobility, and
                    neurological, stimulating sensory receptors that provide vital feedback to the brain and
                    spinal cord.</p>
                        <br>
                    <p>This stimulation helps reduce muscle spasms, modulate pain sensations, and
                    improve movement, coordination, and posture. Some people have reported additional
                    benefits of being more comfortable, such as better sleep, increased calmness, and improved
                    alertness. Chiropractic treatment encompasses are range of techniques and manipulation is
                    one part of this. Not all conditions require manipulation and other techniques can be used
                    for example, soft tissue work, joint mobilisation, stretches, education, particular exercises,
                    acupuncture and ultrasound.</p><br>
                    <p>Chiropractic care offers a drug and surgery-free approach to treating joint, bone, and
                    muscle problems and their impact on well-being. Chiropractors prioritise patient-centred
                    care, utilising shared decision-making and tailored communication strategies to meet each
                    patient&#39;s unique needs and preferences.</p>

            <img src="open-book.gif" alt="Image 8">
            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>Chiropractors receive specialised education to adapt spinal manual therapy to suit patients
                    of different ages and conditions. Chiropractic treatment is based on the scientific
                    understanding that the body is a self-regulating, self-healing organism, controlled by the
                    brain, spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. All chiropractors in the UK receive a
                    high level of training graduating from university after a 4- or 5-year degree. Chiropractors in
                    the UK must be registered with the General Chiropractic Council.</p>

            <div class="slide-content">
                <p>The practice of chiropractic focuses on the relationship between the structure of the body, primarily the spine and pelvis, and its function, as coordinated by the nervous system, to promote and restore health.<br>
