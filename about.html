            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My introduction to Chiropractic was as a 17-year-old patient and this is where my interest in
                health and well-being started.</p>

            <p>I have a passion for working with people to increase their understanding of pain - research
                shows that increased pain literacy leads to better self-management. My role is to enable
                people to access the knowledge they need to take charge of their health and well-being. I
                enjoy using a wide range of techniques including adjustments (the chiropractic word for
                joint manipulation), soft tissue work, mobilisation alongside specific exercises, with a
                particular interest in Pilates, relaxation-strategies for managing stress and western medical
                acupuncture. I am particularly interested in helping people to become aware of the impact
                that physical, emotional and lifestyle stressors can have on the body and explore ways to
                minimise these.</p>

            <p>I graduated from Macquarie University, Australia in 1995 with a Masters in Chiropractic. I
                am registered with the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) and hold membership with the
                British Chiropractic Association, the Royal College of Chiropractors (RCC), the British Medical
                Acupuncture Society (BMAS) and the British School of Meditation (BSoM).</p>

            <p>My love of learning and education led me to a Senior Lecturer (Clinical) post at the
                University of Surrey on their Chiropractic Programme. I subsequently obtained my PGCE at
                the Institute of Education, London. I am part of the Test of Competence Assessor team with
                the GCC. I am a meditation teacher and I am currently working towards a Diploma in Pain
                Management with the RCC, a Certificate of Western Medical Acupuncture and have recently
                embarked on study and training to become a psychotherapist.</p>

            <p>As part of my commitment to excellence in care I make sure that I engage in joyful, playful
                activities like: learning new things, country walking, swimming in the sea, sitting in the
                hammock in my garden, meditation, cycling, upholstery, learning Japanese, travelling and
                being with my family and friends.</p>
