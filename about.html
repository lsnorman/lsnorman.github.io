            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My introduction to Chiropractic was as a 17-year-old patient and this is where my interest in health and well-being started.</p>

            <p>I enjoy working with people to increase their understanding of pain - research shows that increased pain literacy leads to better self-management. My role is to enable people to access the knowledge they need to take charge of their health and well-being.</p>

            <p>I enjoy using a wide range of techniques including adjustments (the chiropractic word for joint manipulation), soft tissue work, mobilisation alongside specific exercises with a particular interest in Pilates and relaxation-strategies for managing stress.</p>

            <p>I graduated from Macquarie University, Australia in 1995 with a Masters in Chiropractic. I am registered with the General Chiropractic Council (GCC) and hold membership with the British Chiropractic Association, the Royal College of Chiropractors (RCC), the British Medical Acupuncture Society (BMAS) and the British School of Meditation (BSoM).</p>

            <p>My love of learning and education led me to a Senior Lecturer (Clinical) post at the University of Surrey on their Chiropractic Programme. I subsequently obtained my PGCE at the Institute of Education, London. I am part of the Test of Competence Assessor team with the GCC. I am a meditation teacher and I am currently working towards a Diploma in Pain Management with the RCC and a Certificate of Western Medical Acupuncture followed by the Diploma.</p>

            <p>As well as my work, I enjoy learning new things, country walking, swimming in the sea, sitting in the hammock in my garden, meditation, cycling, upholstery, learning Japanese, travelling and being with my family and friends.</p>
