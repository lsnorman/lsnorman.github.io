                    <h3>Your First Visit</h3>
                    <p>Every individual&#39;s situation is unique. Your chiropractor will need to perform a
                        comprehensive history and assessment to determine the potential for assistance and the
                        optimal approach to address your issue. We will listen to your worries, concerns, the
                        challenges you&#39;ve been facing and your goals. </p><br>

                    <p>If additional investigations such as blood tests, x-rays, or MRI scans are necessary, a referral
                        can be arranged. A clear explanation of the proposed treatment, including benefits and
                        potential complications, will be provided, allowing you the chance to ask questions before
                        making a decision to proceed.</p><br>

                    <p>If appropriate and agreed, treatment often takes place during the same visit. Kindly wear
                        comfortable and loose clothing, and you&#39;re welcome to bring someone along if you prefer.</p>

                    <h3>Your treatment, your choice</h3>
                    <p>At Collins Chiropractic we are committed to personalised care with your goals and choices at
                        the very centre of our approach. Time will always be available for you to ask questions.
                        Increasing knowledge of current pain theory and exploring lifestyle factors that may be
                        influencing your health is often of value.</p><br>
                    <p>There are many other avenues to be explored in the context of overall health. Your
                        chiropractor is able to signpost you to other modalities that may help.</p><br>

                    <p>The treatment length varies. The duration of treatment will depend on many factors with
                        current guidelines and an evidence-based approach being utilised alongside your goals and
                        desired outcomes. Typically, 2 to 6 treatments are common, with sessions gradually spaced
                        out. Longer-standing or recurrent problems might need extended treatment. Your
                        chiropractor will be able to give you an idea after the first visit along with planning for re-
                        assessment along the way.</p>
